# Laundry Cashier

An app that i wrote for my final project of my Object Oriented Programming Lecture, A laundry cashier software.

In this project i used Netbeans for the IDE and MySQL for the database. I wrote this code in Java but github miss-detect this code as a HTML code, I have no idea.

# Dependency
 1. JCalender 1.4
 2. JDBC
